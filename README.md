-This a full stack application built on a MongoDB/Node/Express stack, utilizing RESTful architecture with Bootstrap 4 CSS framework for styling.

-The app performs CRUD operations for users, the campground and the comments. These pieces are referenced within the database through various associations.

-Actionable commands are displayed dynamically on the site (edit/delete) for campground and comments, depending on a userâ€™s authorization/ownership.

-User authorization and authentication in place for various routes, utilizing Passport.js and related submodules.

-Flash messages handle error and success messages to provide the visitor with feedback and improve UX.

-Much of the code has been modularized into separate pieces, including routes, middleware (session authentication), and database models.

I worked on this project before familiarizing myself with Git/GitHub so I did version control locally on my laptop.
